It is better to use diphacinone on a per unit basis for rats and mice, however, the risk is small animals such as household pets would eat the block (or children), putting the company at risk. However, it is very difficult for this to be the case, given the block is placed inside of a trap. If you have ever seen a mouse under surveillance, they are neophobic, and like our ancestors would not simply devour a new object whole. The trap in itself is a new object, and that coupled with another object like a food block, is inherently suspect.

The issue is a block would need a rather large dose of Vitamin D to be effective. Dogs are less amenable to Vitamin D poisoning, and once again, if your dog is eating a plastic bait trap, they are at risk of intussception and asphyxia. 

And that high dose (100 mg / block) costs money. 

Vitamin D, in practicality, is not a potent rodenticide. In theory - it would still not be at all. There would still be excess survivability if one were to gastric lavage
cholecalciferol to a poor rat, a la foie gras. The main mechanism would be the kidney's inability to handle the excess calcium, so at no point would that be a 
painless death, but rather death by kidney stones. 

The difficulty lies in the phenomonenon of aversion. The functionality of rodenticide is predicated
on the fallacy that a rat, having digested an object that makes them deathly ill, will inexplicably go back for seconds. 
Lao Tzu — 'There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent.'

Hypercalcemia would start to slowly reduce the QT interval, not exactly yielding a rapid and painless death as imparted by bought and paid for corporate mouse psychologists.
That's what Big Rodenticide wants you to believe. And while the dose is inappropriately low, and appropriately high dose would essentially cause their heart to explode. If you have
ever had a myocardial infarction, it is very panic-inducing and dysphoric, not feelings exclusive to homo sapiens. 

I digress. It is not dosed high enough, you can skip over the following part if you do not want to see the work.  

This assumes that the rat scarfs down an entire block, which is, of course, inexplicably covered in plastic. It assumes that LD50 follows a logit distribution, 
and that a rat eats 25 grams per 24 hour period. Vitamin D rapidly reaches Cmax, so it will essentially make them sick before they can eat the entire block. 

For rats, the lethal dose (LD50) values for cholecalciferol fall in the range of 42 mg/kg to 128 mg/kg.

Given a 14 gram trap with a concentration of 0.075% cholecalciferol:
14grams
×0.00075
=0.0105 grams

14 grams
0.00075
0.0105 grams
0.0105 grams×1000
=10.5 milligrams (mg)

0.0105 grams×1000= 10.5 milligrams (mg)

So, the 14 gram trap contains 10.5 mg of cholecalciferol.

For rats, lethal dose (LD50) values for cholecalciferol range between 42 mg/kg to 128 mg/kg of body weight, depending on the source and specific conditions.

Considering an average adult rat (like the Norway rat) weighing about 300 grams (or 0.3 kg) and using the lower end of the toxicity range (42 mg/kg):

0.3 kg×42 mg/kg=12.6 mg

This suggests that approximately 12.6 mg of cholecalciferol could be a lethal dose for 50% of average-sized rats.

The 14 gram trap contains 10.5 mg of cholecalciferol. This is slightly below the 12.6 mg potential lethal dose calculated using the lower 
end of the LD50 range for average-sized rats.


By underdosing the Vitamin D in the bait by 50% (this would bring them over the theoretical LD50% peak), Raid would save $441,000 if they sell a million packages per year, assuming that Vitamin D costs $7 per kilogram. 

But this discounts the inactive ingredients as well, but it's fair to assume that cellulose, flour, or other commonly used excipients cost less than Vitamin D (even though the latter is pretty cheap).
